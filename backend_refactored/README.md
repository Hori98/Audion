# backend_refactored (Paused)

This directory was created for a future modular refactor of the backend.

- Current status: paused â€” no production code here.
- Active backend: `backend/server.py` and related `routers/`, `services/`.

If refactor resumes, start by migrating small, isolated routers/services and
add integration tests before switching traffic.
